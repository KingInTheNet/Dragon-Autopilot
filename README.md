# Dragon-Autopilot
No, this is not the official SpaceX opensource spacecraft autopilot. This is just me trying to create a cheat tool for the the SpaceX ISS Docking Simulator. 
You need to run this using the Cốc Cốc browser. First open a tab and browse to the [ISS Docking Simulator](https://iss-sim.spacex.com/). Then open a powershell and run pilot.py. If you don't like using Cốc Cốc you can change it to what ever browser you feel like in pilot.py, it should be pretty straight forward if you can speak Parseltongue
